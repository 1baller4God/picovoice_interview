Why is your design an improvement?

I found the Pytorch widget design to be fairly straightforward. However, my design adds bounce and user flow to the installation process. 
It allows the user to select options, similar to a quiz. Enabling the user to go back and forth between settings. And of course, the code container automatically updates its content with every new selection.
